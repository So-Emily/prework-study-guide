# Em's Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project is the beginning of the adventure that is the UC Berkley Coding Bootcamp.
I am motivated by my love for code and want to expand my knowledge about it all.

This webpage contains notes on HTML, CSS, git, and JavaScript
Including a small inspect console loop.

It solves the problem of having a place to show what we have been learning through this camp.
Maybe it could help other students or individuals delving into this code world.

I learned how to use HTML and actually process what things will do with css and html when looking at the code.

WARNING: This Project used different colors than the origin tutorial asked.

## Installation

This assignment is web based. For the most part you will need to open the link for the page. And the console in inspect if that interests you. But The inside code involves multiple files and assets that when compiled in (VS Code for this example) will create the outcome of the webpage.


## Credits

I collaborated with Berkely's Bootcamp Spot instuctions. They were very straight forward and easy to understand.
I also used the ai chat to look up a few css labels to help make spaces where I wanted.

## Tests
